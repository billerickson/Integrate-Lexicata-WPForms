Connect WPForms to the Lexicata Law Firm CRM.

== Description ==

"Integrate Lexicata and WPForms" easily connects forms on your website to your [Lexicata](https://lexicata.com/) Law Firm CRM, enabling you to capture more leads and manage campaigns more effectively.

[WPForms](https://www.billerickson.net/go/wpforms/)' simple drag-and-drop form builder allows you to create new forms with ease and its clean, modern code makes customizations a snap. This integration also works with the free version, [WPForms Lite](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wpforms-lite/), but I highly recommend purchasing the full WPForms for the valuable premium features and support.

Please support the development of this free plugin by using the WPForms affiliate link above.

== Installation ==

 1. Install this plugin, along with [WPForms](https://www.billerickson.net/go/wpforms/) (or [WPForms Lite](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wpforms-lite/)).
 2. In the WordPress Dashboard, go to WPForms > Add New and create a form. You can add whatever fields you like, but at a minimum you must include an Email and Name field. (See screenshot 1)
 3. Click “Settings” in the left column, then select "Lexicata". From the two dropdowns, select the Name and Email fields you created. (See screenshot 2)
 4. In a separate browser tab, go to Lexicata, log in, copy your authorization key, go back to the WPForms Lexicata settings page, and paste it in the field titled "Lexicata Authorization Key”.
 5. Click “Save” in the top right corner, and exit out of the form builder.
 6. Insert the form somewhere on your site and test it out! Go to Pages, select a page, and above the content editor click “Add Form”. Select your form and click “Insert” to add it to the page.
